The two keywords cout in C++ and cin in C++ are used very often for printing outputs and taking inputs respectively. These two are the most basic methods of taking input and printing output in C++. To use cin and cout in C++ one must include the header file iostream in the program.

Standard output stream (cout): Usually the standard output device is the display screen. The C++ cout statement is the instance of the ostream class. It is used to produce output on the standard output device which is usually the display screen. The data needed to be displayed on the screen is inserted in the standard output stream (cout) using the insertion operator(<<).

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
    char sample[] = "GeeksforGeeks";
 
    cout << sample << " - A computer science portal for geeks";
 
    return 0;
}
```

standard input stream (cin): Usually the input device in a computer is the keyboard. C++ cin statement is the instance of the class iostream and is used to read input from the standard input device which is usually a keyboard. 
The extraction operator(>>) is used along with the object cin for reading inputs. The extraction operator extracts the data from the object cin which is entered using the keyboard.

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
    int age;
 
    cout << "Enter your age:";
    cin >> age;
    cout << "\nYour age is: " << age;
 
    return 0;
}
```
