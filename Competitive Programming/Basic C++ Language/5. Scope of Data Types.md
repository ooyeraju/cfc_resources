## Data Types

All variables use data-type during declaration to restrict the type of data to be stored. Therefore, we can say that data types are used to tell the variables the type of data it can store. Whenever a variable is defined in C++, the compiler allocates some memory for that variable based on the data-type with which it is declared. Every data type requires a different amount of memory.

1. Primitive Data Types: These data types are built-in or predefined data types and can be used directly by the user to declare variables. example: int, char , float, bool etc. Primitive data types available in C++ are: 

- Integer
- Character
- Boolean
- Floating Point
- Double Floating Point
- Valueless or Void
- Wide Character

2. Derived Data Types: The data-types that are derived from the primitive or built-in datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types. These can be of four types namely: 
- Function
- Array
- Pointer
- Reference

3. Abstract or User-Defined Data Types: These data types are defined by user itself. Like, defining a class in C++ or a structure. C++ provides the following user-defined datatypes: 
- Class
- Structure
- Union
- Enumeration
- Typedef defined DataType

 

Integer: Keyword used for integer data types is int. Integers typically requires 4 bytes of memory space and ranges from -2147483648 to 2147483647. 
 
Character: Character data type is used for storing characters. Keyword used for character data type is char. Characters typically requires 1 byte of memory space and ranges from -128 to 127 or 0 to 255. 
 
Boolean: Boolean data type is used for storing boolean or logical values. A boolean variable can store either true or false. Keyword used for boolean data type is bool. 
 
Floating Point: Floating Point data type is used for storing single precision floating point values or decimal values. Keyword used for floating point data type is float. Float variables typically requires 4 byte of memory space. 
 
Double Floating Point: Double Floating Point data type is used for storing double precision floating point values or decimal values. Keyword used for double floating point data type is double. Double variables typically requires 8 byte of memory space. 
 
void: Void means without any value. void datatype represents a valueless entity. Void data type is used for those function which does not returns a value. 
 
## Scope

A scope is a region of the program and broadly speaking there are three places, where variables can be declared âˆ’

 Inside a function or a block which is called local variables,
 In the definition of function parameters which is called formal parameters.
 Outside of all functions which are called global variables.


Local Variable: Local variables can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions on their own. 

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main () {
   // Local variable declaration:
   int a, b;
   int c;

   // actual initialization
   a = 10;
   b = 20;
   c = a + b;

   cout << c;
   return 0;
``` 
Output:
```
30
```

Global Variables: Global variables are defined outside of all the functions, usually on top of the program. The global variables will hold their value throughout the lifetime of your program. A global variable can be accessed by any function.

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
// Global variable declaration:
int g;
int main () {
   // Local variable declaration:
   int a, b;

   // actual initialization
   a = 10;
   b = 20;
   g = a + b;

   cout << g;
   return 0;
}
```
Output:
```
30
```

A program can have the same name for local and global variables but the value of a local variable inside a function will take preference. For accessing the global variable with same rame, you'll have to use the scope resolution operator. 

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
// Global variable declaration:
int g = 20;
int main () {
   // Local variable declaration:
   int g = 10;

   cout << g;   // Local
   cout << ::g; // Global
   return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
10
20
```
